# nw-hover-image-bg
Creates a new cornerstone element for the [X-Theme][2] that changes the background image of a section when the user hovers on the link. When the link/thumbnail is hovered over, the chosen background image is used as a background for the section it is in.

##Installation
This plugin will only work with the [X-Theme][2].
Install the plugin through the WordPress admin plugins interface using this [zip][1] file.
Edit a page in Cornerstone and you will see a new element "Hover w/ Image Bg".

##Usage
Choose an image for the thumbnail and for the background when hovered on the thumbnail. 
The "Link Class" field can be used to add classes to style the heading.
